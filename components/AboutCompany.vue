    <h2>The Firm</h2>
    <p class="card-container">
      <span class="emphasis"> Lok Engineering </span> is a full-service
      structural engineering firm based in Oakland, California. Our projects
      range from minor remodels to large-scale residential construction. During
      the design process, we collaborate with all design consultants to discuss
      strategies for providing the best structural solution for the project's
      specific needs. We work with contractors during the construction phase and
      provide quick responses to RFIs and solutions to construction-related
      issues that arise. From the preliminary design phase to the construction
      phase, we are committed to providing the highest quality service to our
      clients.
